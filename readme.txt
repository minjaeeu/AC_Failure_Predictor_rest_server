	/ac_info/get/all_entries ->  gets all the entries on the db
	/ac_info/get/first_entry -> gets the first entry from the db
	/ac_info/get/last_entry -> gets the last entry from the db
	/ac_info/get/new_entry -> adds a new entry to the db


** You can edit the host:port location by changing the variables in ./configurations/server_config.py
